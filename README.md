Different screens I made for the application.

Currently using Virstual Studio Code as editor. 

HOW TO I RUN IT?
You can run it on Expo app on your phone by scanning 
the QR code printed by the command "expo start" in the terminal window, or run it through a simulator/emulator like Android Studio, for instance.
