# Small-task
Different screens I made for the application.

Currently using Virtual Studio Code as editor. 

### **HOW TO I RUN IT?**
You can run it on Expo app on your phone by scanning 
the QR code printed by the command "expo start" in the terminal window, or run it through a simulator/emulator like Android Studio, for instance. Remember to turn on the option "PRODUCTION MODE". 

Download Android Studio here: https://developer.android.com/studio

### **HOW GET STARTED WITH EXPO?**
Follow this guide: https://expo.io/learn

Download the files from github, navigate to the right map in the terminal window and run "expo start". 



I will also make it as a Snack and link it here later.

### **Button on the screens**
HomeScreen: "Log in here" leads to LogInScreen

LogInScreen: "SIGN IN" leads to SignedInScreen, while "Sign Up" goes back to HomeScreen.

SignedInScreen: "Hi, Katarina!" goes back to LogInScreen (temporarily solution so I can navigate to pevious screen).
